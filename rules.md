# Rules

From: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Monopoly/Official_Rules

On a player's turn, the player must roll the dice and move his/her token forward the number of spaces as rolled on the dice. In some editions, players must do any trades, building improvements etc. at the start of their turn before rolling the dice.
 
 If the player lands on an unowned property, the player may buy it for the price listed on that property's space. If he or she agrees to buy it, he or she pays the Bank the amount shown on the property space and receives the deed for that property. If he or she refuses to buy the property for the amount stated on the deed, the property is auctioned. Bidding may start at any price, and all players may bid. The highest bidder wins the property and pays the Bank the amount bid and receives the property's title deed. Railroads and utilities are also considered properties.
 
 If the player lands on an unmortgaged property owned by another player, he or she pays rent to that person, as specified on the property's deed. It is the property owner's responsibility to demand rent, and he or she has until the beginning of the second following player's turn to do so.
 
 If the player lands on his or her own property, or on property which is owned by another player but currently mortgaged, nothing happens.
 
 If the player lands on Luxury Tax/Super Tax, he or she must pay the Bank $100 (in some editions of the game, only $75).
 
 If the player lands on Income Tax he or she must pay the Bank either $200 or 10% of his or her total assets (cash on hand, property, houses and hotels). In some editions of the game, this is a flat rate of $200.
 
 If the player lands on a Chance or Community Chest, the player takes a card from the top of the respective pack and performs the instruction given on the card.
 
 If the player lands on the Jail space, he or she is "Just Visiting". No penalty applies.
 
 If the player lands on the Go to Jail square, he or she must move his token directly to Jail.
 
 If the player lands on or passes Go in the course of his or her turn, he or she receives $200 from the Bank. A player has until the beginning of his or her next turn to collect this money.
 
 You may sell houses back to the Bank for half the purchase price or sell property deeds to other players in the game.
 
 Players may not loan money to other players. Only the Bank can loan money, and only through mortgaging properties.
 
 If a player skips another player's turn and is caught, the turn is transferred back to the player whose turn was skipped.
